In November of 2007, most likely sitting inside an East
Nashville Panera Bread location, I first signed on to
Twitter. Last weekend, I deactivated my account.

During the years in-between, my profile has been
a professional and personal asset, used equally as
a promotional tool for current projects, a platform for
offering advice to fellow creatives, a megaphone for
healthcare advocacy, and a networking tool often used to
sustain early stage business relationships. Friends may sign in
to Facebook daily, but in every way, I preferred
Twitter.

Recently, my relationship with the network became strained by a lack of
everything I once valued: the ability to read only tweets (and re-tweets) from
accounts I followed, in reverse-chronological order, was being replaced by
a focus on "topics," while CEO Jack Dorsey admitted that he has zero interest
in censoring white supremacist content. These decisions and comments eroded
their users' trust, mine especially. Add in a clear look at the outrage machine
that Twitter's modern platform has become, where accounts who thrive on
discontent contort language to misrepresent your intentions, and it was all too
much for this longtime user.

Will I fill out a Mastodon profile with tiny missives? Probably not, but only
time will tell. Until then, anything I have to say can, and will be said here;
a considered longform venue. All I know is this: in an age where liars scream
deceptions from the rooftops and truth is nearly silent, two hundred eighty
characters isn't enough for me.
