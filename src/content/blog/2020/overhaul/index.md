Regardless of the domain where it can be accessed, this site has always had one, consistent job: to introduce myself and the work I do.

At my core, I am a storyteller who uses technologies to craft and maintain
a narrative. The "digital darkroom" movement was critical because it allowed
me to produce more work in less time, just as affordable, high-quality audio
interfaces fueled my desires to share stories in audio. For example: I'm
redesigning this website because it fails to communicate who I've become in
the past year, rather than being driven by sheer boredom and desire to tinker
with the next, shiny toy.

## Technology

While I'm no stranger to Node.js, Gatsby, React, or GraphQL, I have always
found JavaScript-based systems propose a difficult trade-off for the kinds of
websites I usually build: long builds are cost of a highly-interactive
front-end.

After reviewing several tools for building static websites, I settled on Hugo,
content in the knowledge I could always return course and choose Gatsby if
learning new APIs proved too much. Thanks to ample documentation, I have
rarely had a moment of confusion. Still, I've encountered several oddities
(like how difficult it is to [print formatted strings of a page's last
modified date][aral]).

In all honesty, I've struggled with Go's `html/template` whitespace handling
more than anything else, but is resolving that single issue so important?
Would it be fun to spend a couple of days developing my own content management
sytsem? Yes. It is out of scope for a simple redesign? Also yes.

Technology exists to serve design goals; not the other way around.
