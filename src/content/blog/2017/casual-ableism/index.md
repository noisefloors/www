In order to help you best understand the past few weeks, we begin this post listening in on a recent conversation with my neurologist.

"Can you stand?" "Yes, but only for a minute or two, maximum," I replied, his
furrowed brow telling me all I needed to know. "Are your legs really that weak?" I quickly retorted.
"If you'll look at the chart, the purpose of this visit is to
investigate possible small fiber neuropathy in all four limbs, plus muscle
weakness and numbness in my lower extremities."

I'm no longer surprised by how quickly medical staff dismiss potentially
valuable information, but this office set new records. By this point, the staff
had already turned down MRI data I asked them to retrieve, and I was quickly
realizing how little the physician himself cared for my perspective.

Soon, it became obvious that I'd need to stand, but I didn't expect to push well beyond
my limit, complaining as the room became blurry and I collapsed into my
wheelchair.

Inside the office of a healer should be the safest space for a rare, chronic
illness patient such as myself. And yet, ableism has permeated our culture to a
point where it becomes just another venue for abuse.

Hello. If you're new to my blog, welcome. I'm Nicholas Young, a technologist
from Denver, Colorado. In October of 2015 [I was
diagnosed](/2016-05/life-on-the-inside/) with a rare genetic illness, [Ehlers
Danlos Syndrome](https://ehlers-danlos.org). EDS itself affects my skin, joint
cartilage, blood vessels &mdash; anything that is made of collagen, whether in
whole or part. My joints are excessively lax and subluxate or disclocate easily,
making it structurally difficult to stand, let alone walk.

But even if my bones could stay in place, I fatigue quickly and need to sit
within a few minutes in order to curb intense vertigo. My knees and ankles
occasionally catch and lock when in motion, adding to my fall risk.

As a patient with a rare condition, life often passes in flashes: rapid-fire
memories of doctors appointments, each with it's own flurry of activity,
whether the effort helps your condition or not. It's a rote dance
that most medical practitioners surrender to early on; while as the patient,
you're left to quietly go through the motions. There are days when even a great
appointment with my preferred physician leaves me depressed: not for what
happened during my visit, but that I once again have more questions than
answers. Looking back, I can certainly say the past few weeks are a tepid mix of
positive reinforcement and outright degredation.

I realized I'll always have more questions than answers.

This post was intended for publication on May 30, neatly conluding
[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Awareness Month](https://ehlers-danlos.com/dazzle/), but
was significantly delayed when I encounted a nasty bout of unexpected,
disruptive ableism.

Every year during the month of May, [Zebras from around the world join
forces](https://ehlers-danlos.com/dazzle/) to shine a light on the often
unthinkable symptoms caused by thie pervasive connective tissue disorder.
Passion was already running high this year (thanks to [politics and a whole host
of other contributing factors](/2017-05/becoming-disabled/)) so I planned
several articles. What I could not foresee was that I would put down my crutches
in favor of a wheelchair also during the month of May. I knew my lower
extremeties were weak and uncoordinated, but I din't expect to need mobility
assistance so badly. I'm a realist though, and as my condition changes, so do my
needs. As my needs change, I must write; if not for myself, for the others who
are trapped in their own failing, pain-racked bodies and cannot.

## Life on Four Wheels

On Monday, May 22, shortly after I [published a list of concerns I wish readers
understood](/2017-05/what-i-wish-you-understood-about-my-chronic-illness/)
concerning how I live with chronic illness, my rental wheelchair arrived on our
doorstep. For the first time in over a year, I travelled to the store and
shopped for a pair of new slacks, while reveling in how otherwise difficult (or
impossible) tasks were made accessible (even magical) by my new mobility device.
Even more surprising, I found myself volunteering to run small family errands
that were impossible even when I could walk without aids. I told my wife to
take her planned out-of-state trip, because I wouldn't be falling regularly.

Thanks to a community of [wheelchair](https://www.youtube.com/user/heycrip)-
[using](https://www.youtube.com/user/theannieelainey) YouTubers, it only took me
24 hours to glimpse how I would work, play, and live on four wheels. I hadn't
considered using the chair at home so often, but during my evaluation for a
custom-fit chair, my new-and-improved physical therapy team recommended it until
my stability and body awareness improves.

The excitement being able to attend meetups with reduced pain and travel
safely to and from my many doctors appointments without fear of further injury is
indescribable. Never again will I be denied a seat on a crowded bus because my
impairment isn't visible until I hit the ground.

Since December, I have used a pair of forearm crutches to take the weight off my
bad leg and prevent falls. Unfortunately, they were only minimally useful. My
wrists and hands can't bear the weight required to effectively stabilize
myself. It's also suspected that I have Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia
Syndrome (POTS), a form of
[dysautonomia](http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30) that
contributes to my instability and vision blurriness when standing. This, friends,
is the second of many significant comorbidities that I live with, and it
illustrates my most terrifying fear about life with a connective tissue
disorder: any part of my body can fail, at any time, and without warning.

The chair functions as a support for my unpredictable body, diffuses a
significant portion of the daily musculoskeletical pain, and telegraphs my
formerly invisible disability to the world. But while my wheelchair has prompted
a certain class of individuals to step in and assist when necessary, it has also
invited much unwanted attention.

## Hazards of Visibility

The scariest thing I've yet to face as my body degrades is a lack of intellectual
autonomy. Everyone seems to be an expert on disability except the disabled.
Functionally, this means every time I comment issues of accessability in public,
I become awkwardly entangled.

After I received my rental wheelchair, my perspective on the world shifted in a
very physical sense &mdash; standing, I last measured over six-feet &mdash; but
in the chair, I see the world from a reduced height. I'm relating to normal
objects very differently, pushing up to the counter and locking my brakes rather
than grotesquely dragging my body with crutches to the nearest chair, only
hoping I could make it before the dizziness and disorientation took over.

I told my wheelchair supplier to design a chair capable of traveling worldwide
with me as I begin another season of speaking on the conference circuit. I enjoy
sharing knowledge, and my new series of talks will focus on my expanding
universe as a technologist who is becoming physically disabled. I hope you'll
join me somewhere on the road. Simultaneously, I'm slowly realizing how
inaccessible many spaces are, especially, it seems, many spaces where meet-ups
or conferences are held. [Gophercon](https://gophercon.com) is known as a
standout among events for it's attention to detail, having provided
[professional real-time captioning
services](https://twitter.com/gophercon/status/753604502268149760) for talks
presented at the 2016
conference. Conferences are catching up to broadcast accessiblity standards,
but there is still much more to be done.

Sitting with these thoughts as my Twitter feed scrolled by, I commented on [this
short video](https://twitter.com/nicholaswyoung/status/867220778043002884) of a
conference instructor leading the audience in a moment of vigorous group
exercise:

> "I'm pondering how I would feel in this event as a person with physical
> disability."

If you're looking for a case study to underpin my earlier assertion (*everyone
seems to be an expert on disablity except the disabled*), observe closely. In
response to my question, I quickly receive the obviously hilarious response,
"probably relieved they didn't have to participate." I should've thanked my
conversation partner for the opportunity to place ableist elitism on clear
display, because never have I experienced an example in the real world
that has been documented so well.

A few days prior, I requested that a gentlemen refrain from using slurs for the
mentally disabled to describe his frustration in the grocery store. He
extrapolated the fact that I'm in a wheelchair, diagnosed me with developmental
disabilities, and began apologizing repeatedly. An act of justice left me with a
creepy older gentlemen patting my knee, trying to atone for something he clearly didn't understand.

In the case of my Twitter exchange, I was told, "I thought you were asking about
a hypothetical person."

The disconnect is obvious. Anytime I speak on issues of access or disability,
I become either the target for offenders' apologies or the trademark "other"
disabled individual &mdash; which ever is more convenient and padding to their
ego. This has to stop, because it sweeps away realities of the disabled,
substituting them for a momentary positive feeling. Individuals of all genders are
capable of these ableist attitudes, so understand that while we're working on to
correct a problem with gender imbalance in my field, we must also put a stop to
the ableist ideas that keep disabled contributors out of the fray.

I don't have to earn my name in the technical field. If I'm finding it difficult
to re-enter the workforce for disability concerns, can you imagine the challenge
someone else, perhaps new to the industry, might face? As key companies focus
more on output, how does this align with a productive strategy for someone with
limited energy? I feel that we have a long way to go when it comes to
accomidating the disabled, even for a field that isn't physically
demanding.

## Where We Go From Here

I've been asked by friends, and even asked myself: what comes next? That chapter
is still being written.

I'm waiting on a permanent wheelchair to be constructed for me [in the woods of
Washington](https://permobilus.com/products/manual-wheelchairs-by-tilite/), but
the process is taking much longer than expected. Once it is completed, I'll have
the opportunity to work more effectively and travel more frequently. Extended local trips can be difficult
with the rental wheelchair due to extra weight, an issue I've purposefully designed around
by insisting the frame of my custom-fit chair be made of titanium. With any luck, it will arrive within
the predicted three-to-six-month time-frame.

Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is, for me, characterized by a multi-headed beast that
seemingly appears whenever I have important tasks. If I decide to launch a new
business venture? EDS appears and causes severe pain and fatigue. When
traveling, I'll lay down on an unfamiliar bed and dislocate one of my major
weight bearing joints in my back. My chair is one more weapon that I can rely
on, a protective measure that allows me to perform tasks of daily living. And
I'll need it, especially I've planned a medical vacation &mdash; a period of time where I
don't schedule or attend any doctors visits &mdash; very soon. It will
help restore my mental health, but I must also support my body.

Writing three posts on the topic of chronic illness in such a short timespan has
proved draining and infinitely more complex than I could've imagined. I hope
that I've been able to introduce you to a slice of my reality.
