On episode twenty-four of Gender Inbetween, Kriss welcomes their youngest guest yet, Asher White. Asher hails from Evanston, Illinois, a place that was once home to the Temperance movement, and now, is one of the most liberal communities in America.

"I didn't really think about gender a lot &mdash; at all... or not at all, I thought about it a lot &mdash; but it wasn't a huge part of my life because I grew up in such a lovely, and liberal, and open community, where I never felt forced."

"I hear all these stories of genderqueer people, throughout their life, and they're talking about the time that they realized they were forced into this gender. They're like, 'I feel oppressed...', and I never really felt that. I'm always trying to be aware of how privileged [I am]. It's a major, major privilege that I have. I never really was like, 'I have to be a boy,' and everyone's telling me that I have to be a boy. My parents were always super, super open &mdash; and even celebrated gender exploration."
