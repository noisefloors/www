Living outside the gender binary can be difficult, especially when your friends and family issue ultimatums, begging you to change. Today's guest, Justin Marc Lloyd, knows this all too well. "About a year ago, I had to write my parents this really elaborate letter, that sort of explained what my deal was. ... That's when I really figured things out. It was written because my dad said, 'I'll give you a grand if you use the money to cut your hair and dye it back to a normal color and get a new wardrobe.'"

"I was really offended and I texted my mom after this talk and was like 'do you agree with this?' and came to find they both felt the same way. So, a week later, I wrote this long letter saying, 'No. No, thank you, and second of all...' and just poured it out, I guess. The next morning, I woke up to texts from my dad saying, 'We got your note and I want to say right now that we love you for who you are and we're really sorry...'"
