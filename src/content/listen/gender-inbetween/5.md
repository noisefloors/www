It's no secret that strict religiosity has bred many enemies for those who identify somewhere in the LGBTQIA spectrum. But it also does harm to those living within its sacred culture. On this episode of Gender Inbetween, Susan Young shares her story of triumph over a strict, Christian upbringing, and the emotional baggage related to it.

"It was weird to hear things like, 'oh, don't do a fist pump, because boys do that.' It was the late 80's when I was a little kid. I would go 'yes!' and pump my fist &mdash; you know, like every kid in that era &mdash; but it was like 'no, no... that's a boy's move.'"

"[I was brought up in] extremely strict gender roles. Not only that, but fast forward and as a woman, I was meant to stay at home and live under my father's 'protection and authority' until marriage. In which case, I would move onto someone else's 'protection and authority.'"
