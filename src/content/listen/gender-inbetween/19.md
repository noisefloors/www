In episode 19 of Gender Inbetween, Francesca Bonapart discusses how her conservative-baptist upbringing skewed her perception of her gender identity in ways that are, to this day, difficult to fully comprehend.

"I guess growing up, it was a lot just being not only gay, but a black female and having to deal with all the racial... I think for me, I really dealt with the racial part of my identity first, and I also didn't want to deal with being gay, since I grew up in a very conservative-baptist household."

"So my thought was, 'I'm not gonna come out until I leave and go to college,' 'cause I always knew I was gonna get out of New Jersey... That was kinda my way of dealing with it, even though it was so hard growing up in that household; for so many reasons, besides being gay..."

"My mother wanted me to be a certain type of woman: it was weird for her to see me with different friends of different races, because she grew up in the segregated south. So, dealing with that... She thought it was cool, but it was different for her."

"Then, going to school for engineering was like... she just wanted me to go to high school then find a great guy to marry, and just have children. She was like, 'do you want to struggle like Mama did? You can just marry a rich guy...' I was like, 'no, Mom, that's never happening.'"
