In episode 23 of Gender Inbetween, friend of The Machine (and possibly our most frequent guest) Christina Dennaoui shares her story. From growing up in a suburb where her parents lived in an arranged marriage, to leaving home and attending school in the big city, Christina's life so far spans many years and cultural experiences.

"I grew up in Dearborn, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. I was the only daughter of two Lebanese immigrants &mdash; their marriage was arranged, which an interesting, slightly different background. So yeah, I grew up in Dearborn, went to school in Kalamazoo, came to Chicago for grad school at the University of Chicago."

"My personal coming out story wasn't a super-great one &mdash; it's certainly changed &mdash; but the whole process of me kinda coming to terms with my sexuality was very... sort-of it was very up in the air, I wasn't sure what I was feeling. So I didn't think that initial attractions to women constituted any kind of identity, or even a real sexual orientation at first. At first, I thought these were just these fluid moments until it became very clear to toward the end of college and grad school that I'm very clearly a lesbian."
