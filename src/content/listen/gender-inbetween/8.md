Leor Miller discusses their disappointment at not being able to dress as a character from Wicked for Halloween (at the age of 8), before having personal revelations about where they are in the queer spectrum.

"My first memory of kind of feeling unhappy with maleness was a result of being really interested in *Wicked*: identifying with the femininity and the power [of it]."

"I really looked up to Alphaba &mdash; the main character &mdash; and was unhappy when I realized [that] I can't be Alphaba... because I'm a boy. Which wasn't entirely accurate, because I could have been, but I didn't realize that. That was the first time I remember vocally expressing that I wasn't comfortable with the way I'd been brought up to believe, that I was a boy."
