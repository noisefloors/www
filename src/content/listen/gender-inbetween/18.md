In episode 18 of Gender Inbetween, Kriss is joined by Ty Huey, who recounts his evolution: both personally, and in drag as "Lucy Stoole." In fact, this may be the first time you've encountered Ty outside of his persona. "I am Lucy, more than I am Ty," he quips.

"I like to pretend that I was born at twenty-four, when I moved to Chicago... but we all know those backstories are kinda what make us who we are."

"I was born and raised in Kansas City, Kansas, mostly by my grandmother. My mother was around, for most of the time &mdash; I mean, she's always been around for my life &mdash; but she was really young when she had me, and really unsure of what was going on in her own life. So, I spent most of my time with my grandmother, up until the time I moved to Houston, when I was about 11 years old, with my mom, for about four years."

"[That's] when I started to question my sexuality and just about everything else in life... which she was not okay with, so I ended up moving back home with my grandmother to finish high school. And then ... I moved to Iowa, and then to Chicago. I've been here for the past eight years."
