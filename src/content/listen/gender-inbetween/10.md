In this episode of Gender Inbetween, Aidan McCormack discusses being the fifth queer and trans person in the Unitarian Universalist denomination to study to become a minister, and notes changes that need to be made within the LGBTQIA community for wider acceptance among its own ranks.

As you will soon discover, Aidan is unique in more ways than one. "I identify as a gender-fantastic sparkle bear. That is the identification and label that I have come to for myself. What that means, in practicality, I guess is ... I'm trans-masculine; so I transitioned from a female-identified person to someone who, by and large, is identified as male.

Later in the conversation, Aidan touches on a serious subject, a cultural aptitude that seems to be required of many genderqueer individuals. "I think that queer people, particularly during their teenage years, have to develop and social and emotional awareness that many of our peers don't; and we have to do it to survive..."
