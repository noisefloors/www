Today's guest is an artist, creative instigator, musician, and (future) podcaster, [Dee Armagost](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Paper-Boy-Collective/308052232718591).

"I was born and raised in a small town &mdash; it's like this itty bitty, pretty rural place in Pennsylvania &mdash; called Oil City, it's in northwestern P.A. It's a pretty conservative place, it's not really that socially aware... kinda closed minded, or so I thought. A lot of the times people are woefully ignorant, but that's what I thought in the past... I always thought that growing up, but I never really aligned that way or wanted to be like that."

Somehow, over the course of several years, Dee's perception of the small town where they were born began to shift &mdash; despite being labeled as uninformed by both citizens and outsiders.

Today's story is one of evolution, of finding oneself, and learning to look deeper at the problems that may be surfacing in communities around you.
