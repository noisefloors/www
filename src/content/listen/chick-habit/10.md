Danielle and John from [Impulsive Hearts](https://impulsivehearts.bandcamp.com) sit down to discuss their long history of making music together and their experiences recording and releasing their next record. We also talk about whether singling out musicians for being female is detrimental or helpful to our music scene and experiences. 

We share several tracks from their debut, self-titled EP, including *Sorry in the Summertime* and *MDB*. Plus, you'll also hear two beautifully harmonized live in-studio recordings to round out this fun episode!
