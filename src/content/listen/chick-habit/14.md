This week, your ears are in for a treat. In this almost two-hour radio special, we bring you three live performances from our inaugural Chick Habit Live performance showcase. On this bill are our friends [Hawley Shoffner](http://hawleyshoffner.com), [Jap Herron](http://japherron.bandcamp.com), and [Ganser](http://ganser.bandcamp.com) &mdash; all recorded live before our audience of passionate fans! (Also, for the curious, you can find [Jap Herron, the book, right here](https://archive.org/stream/japherronnovelwr00hutciala).)

If you're new to Chick Habit, this could be a great place to start. It's loud and rambunctious, sure &mdash; but it also shows the fun side of a sometimes serious program. Tune in, turn it up, and enjoy!
