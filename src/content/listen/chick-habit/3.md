Different artistic mediums come together as we feature Kate from [She Speaks In Tongues](https://shespeaksintongues.bandcamp.com), a theatrical performer turned singer and songwriter who takes female experiences and sculpts them into breathtaking musical performance pieces.

Joining in are Rae Bees and Piya from [FYC](http://fyczine.com) (For Your Consideration), a Chicago-based zine, who talk about their work bringing attention to those who's voices are not often heard enough.

We talk about safe performance spaces, our breakthroughs as artists, and our extreme love of Alanis Morrisette.
